# Unitodo Frontend

A React frontend for the Unitodo application, displaying todo items organized into categories.

## Features

- Display todos grouped by categories
- Filter todos by status (All/Active/Completed)
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Make sure the markdown file is available:

The frontend expects to find the `unitodo.sync.md` file in the public directory. When you run the Rust backend, it generates this file. You can create a symbolic link to make it accessible to the frontend:

```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/unitodo.sync.md" public/unitodo.sync.md
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Usage

1. First run the Rust backend to generate the todo data:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

2. Then run the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. View your todo items organized by category.
4. Use the filter buttons to show All, Active, or Completed todos.

## Implementation Details

- Built with Next.js and React
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Parses markdown data generated by the Rust backend
